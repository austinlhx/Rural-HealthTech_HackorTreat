# Rural-HealthTech_Hack-Or-Treat 👩🏻‍💻

## This project is built by team `Hack Warrior` in `Hack or Treat` 🎃 Hackathon 2020 under `MLH` 😈

### We realized that especially in rural areas, healthcare could be something hard to come by. It might be hard to find a doctor near you or even to figure out what sort of disease you may/may not have. So, we made it easier for the rural people to have proper medication on time by solving their real life issues. It is a web application that allows you to sign in via Google, you input your current symptoms and our ML model will essentially predict what sort of disease you have and find the nearest doctor in your area. On your dashboard, you can view your history of the previous symptoms you submitted as well as the form that you can upload.

### I worked on the entire Backend portion integrating Google OAuth, Flask, MongoDB, and Radar.
